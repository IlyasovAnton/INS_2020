People are so hyped about it because it's so pretentious, that it makes them feel like "enlightened" ones. I haven't heard a good review of this movie from smart or intelligent people. Only those whose main movie list consists of actions and comedies call this a piece of art.
A wife of a friend even called those who hadn't liked the movie "lemmings" but she's the one from the countryside who dreams of expensive brands and it actually made me laugh my ass out. Now you have an idea who this movie was made for.
The plot is the main weakness. The Phoenix overplays and it feels uncomfortable to watch. The camera work feels very cheap and the overall boredom of the movie makes you start noticing all the imperfections. I would give it 5-6 out of 10 but there are too many pretentious dummies who gave 10 points so I'll even out the difference.
